Server: https://github.com/Tvicer/HybridCryptoSystemServer

This application, together with the server, is a multi-threaded file sharing service that allows you to safely download files from the server and safely send files to it. Hybrid cryptosystem is used for secure data transmission. Asymmetric algorithm "XTR" is used for secure symmetric key exchange between a client and the server, and symmetric algorithm "Serpent" is used for secure file exchange. The application supports different encryption modes and different key sizes. The server serves each client with separate thread. JavaFX was used to create the GUI. For XTR, you need to generate prime numbers. To check the number for primality, the tests of Fermat, Miller-Rabin, Solovay-Strassen were used.
