Server: https://github.com/Tvicer/HybridCryptoSystemServer

This application, together with the server, is a multi-threaded file sharing service that allows you to safely download files from the server and send files to it. A hybrid cryptosystem is used for secure data transmission. The XTR asymmetric algorithm is used for secure key exchange between the client and the server, and the Serpent symmetric algorithm is used for secure file exchange. The application supports different encryption modes and different key sizes. The server serves each client in a separate thread.
